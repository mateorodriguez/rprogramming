```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Initialize scripts**

source('~/R/rprogramming/corr.R')
```


**Question 1** What value is returned by the following call to pollutantmean()? You should round your output to 3 digits.

```{r}
pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)
```

**Question 2** What value is returned by the following call to pollutantmean()? You should round your output to 3 digits.

```{r}
pollutantmean("specdata", "nitrate", 70:72)
```

**Question 3** What value is returned by the following call to pollutantmean()? You should round your output to 3 digits.

```{r}
pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 34)
```

**Question 4** What value is returned by the following call to pollutantmean()? You should round your output to 3 digits.

```{r}
pollutantmean("specdata", "nitrate")
```

**Question 5** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
cc <- complete("specdata", c(6, 10, 20, 34, 100, 200, 310))
print(cc$nobs)
```

**Question 6** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
cc <- complete("specdata", 54)
print(cc$nobs)
```

**Question 7** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
set.seed(42)
cc <- complete("specdata", 332:1)
use <- sample(332, 10)
print(cc[use, "nobs"])
```

**Question 8** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
cr <- corr("specdata")                
cr <- sort(cr)                
set.seed(868)                
out <- round(cr[sample(length(cr), 5)], 4)
print(out)
```


**Question 9** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
cr <- corr("specdata", 129)                
cr <- sort(cr)                
n <- length(cr)                
set.seed(197)                
out <- c(n, round(cr[sample(n, 5)], 4))
print(out)
```

**Question 10** What value is printed at end of the following code?

```{r}
cr <- corr("specdata", 2000)                
n <- length(cr)                
cr <- corr("specdata", 1000)                
cr <- sort(cr)
print(c(n, round(cr, 4)))
```










### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
